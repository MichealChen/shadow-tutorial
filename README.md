# ShadowQPT Tutorial
This repository is a set of notebooks showing how to perform the basic functions in ShadowQPT, or using [classical shadows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0932-7) for Quantum Process Tomography. 
Please see our work on ShadowQPT in [arxiv:2110.02965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02965).
